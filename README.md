### Objective 2:
- [x] Stabilize function
- [x] Notify function

### Objective 4:
- [x] Tests to show functionality of the web service (Use POSTMAN)
- [x] Update the API so it correctly updates the DHT with Key - Location(value) and creates the file with the data.
- [ ] Integration with Chord DHT

### Objective 5:
- [ ] Package previously developed Skynodes as a Docker container
- [ ] Deplou clusters of Skynodes with Kubernetes

### Project Report:
- [ ] Update for each Objective 2
